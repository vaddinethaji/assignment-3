1.) What is the process for loading a dataset from 
an external source?
• When you load data from an external 
source, you load it into a suspense table. 
You can then review the data in the 
suspense table and modify it. To load data 
into the suspense table, position the source 
file or tape, specify the location of the 
source, and run the appropriate load 
external data process
2.) How can we use pandas to read JSON files?
• To read the files, we use read_json() 
function and through it, we pass the path to 
the JSON file we want to read. Once we do 
that, it returns a “DataFrame”( A table of 
rows and columns) that stores data
3.) Describe the significance of DASK.
• Dask is a flexible library for parallel 
computing in Python. Dask is composed of 
two parts: Dynamic task scheduling 
optimized for computation. This is similar to 
Airflow, Luigi, Celery, or Make, but optimized for interactive computational 
workloads
4.) Describe the functions of DASK.
• Dask is a free and open-source library for 
parallel computing in Python. Dask helps 
you scale your data science and machine 
learning workflows. Dask makes it easy to 
work with Numpy, pandas, and Scikit-Learn, 
but that's just the beginning.
5.) Describe Cassandra's features.
• Apache Cassandra is an open source, useravailable, distributed, NoSQL DBMS which is 
designed to handle large amounts of data 
across many servers. It provides zero point 
of failure. Cassandra offers massive support 
for clusters spanning multiple datacentres
